# netGarden
Multidevice autonomic music player

NetGarden runs on raspiberry pi's though any platform that has all the interface libraries will work

The laster versions of the pi make setup much easier. Password and network setup is done in the configuration startup dialogs. This is assuming that you copy the latest NOOBS packages to the sim card and do full setup. 

You still need to enable ssh from the terminal using
* `sudo raspi-config`
